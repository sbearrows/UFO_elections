# UFO sightings and US Elections Frequent Itemsets
## Final Project for CSPB Data Mining


UFO sightings dataset and US elections dataset merged to mine for frequent itemsets using the Apriori Algorithm. Generated several different subsets to investigate
interesting patterns of the dataset, looking at Republican vs Democratic won states to see if sightings correlated with political party. Also investigated if 
the rise of the internet could have caused an increase in the UFO sightings in a pre-1996 vs post-1996.
